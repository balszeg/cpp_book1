We are obviously in awe of the range of software that permeates our techno-
logical civilization. Not all applications of software do good, of course, but that is
another story. Here we wanted to emphasize how pervasive software is and how
much of what we rely on in our daily lives depends on software. It was all written
by people like us. All the scientists, mathematicians, engineers, programmers, etc.
who built the software briefly mentioned here started like you are starting.

If you start wondering if it is worth all your hard work
(most thoughtful people wonder about that sometime), come back and reread this
chapter, the Preface, and bits of Chapter 0 (“Notes to the Reader”). If you start
wondering if you can handle it all, remember that millions have succeeded in be-
coming competent programmers, designers, software engineers, etc. You can, too.
