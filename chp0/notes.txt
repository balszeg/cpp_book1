Book's indicator:
blue - concepts and techniques
green - advice
red - warning

Each section and each chapter assume understanding of what came before.
Each chapter is a reasonably self-contained unit, meant to be read in “one sitting”.
Other criteria include that a chapter is a suitable unit for drills and exercises and
that each chapter presents some specific concept, idea, or technique. 
This plurality of criteria has left a few chapters uncomfortably long, 
so please don’t take “in one sitting” too literally.
